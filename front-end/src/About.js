            <p>My name is Daniel Ni. I am an avid programmer, fitness enthusiast, and gaming enjoyer.</p>
            <p>My overall goal in my career is to become a leader and innovator in the software engineering field at a world-leading company that directs projects that people will use. 
As a programmer, I have been interested in competitive programming, making video games, and making websites. I am well versed in programming with Java, Javascript, C++, and Python. I have always been captivated by competitive programming because of the constant opportunities it has presented to hone my problem solving skills and algorithmic thinking. It has also ingrained a relentless pursuit of excellence as an ever-exapanding mountain to climb as my skills improve further. Simultaneously, I have found great enthusiasm in creating video games because it has given me an outlet to weave creativity with technical skills to create things that are my own. The process of bringing concepts to life from my imagination in video games has been immensely rewarding and fulfilling, sparking an appreciation for the nuances of user experience and software engineering. In addition to the aforementioned pursuits, I have developed a strong interest in web development. Creating websites from an idea in my head to a physical deployment has given me a comprehensive understanding of frontend and backend technologies, and learning how all different modules work and interlock together has been thoroughly fascinating. My proficiency in programming languages as well as my problem solving skills derived from a lifelong curiosity and enthusiasm for solving increasingly complex problems has enabled me to do everything I have done in my programming journey, and I am proud of the person that I have become along the way.
